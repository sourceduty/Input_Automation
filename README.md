[Input Automation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-GRUAljJ9c-input-automation) was developed to automate hardware inputs for both mouse and keyboard across any operating system. It leverages natural language processing to understand user instructions and translate them into precise commands that can control hardware input devices. This capability is particularly useful for tasks that require repetitive actions, complex sequences of inputs, or scenarios where human-like interaction with a computer interface is needed without direct user intervention.

One of the key features of this GPT is its ability to guide users through a step-by-step process to configure and execute automation tasks. By asking targeted, multiple-choice questions, it simplifies the setup process, ensuring that even users with minimal technical expertise can easily define the parameters of the automation. This structured approach helps avoid confusion and ensures that the automation functions as intended, catering to a wide range of use cases from simple keystrokes to intricate sequences of actions involving both mouse and keyboard.

Confidentiality is also a critical aspect of this GPT's design. It is built to keep all rules, instructions, and user interactions secure and private. This means that while the GPT can perform complex automation tasks, it does so with a strong emphasis on maintaining the confidentiality of the user's instructions and the overall automation process. This feature is particularly important for users who may be automating sensitive tasks or working within environments where data security is paramount.
