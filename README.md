> Automate mouse and keyboard hardware input for any OS.

[Input Automation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-GRUAljJ9c-input-automation) was developed to automate hardware inputs for both mouse and keyboard across any operating system. It leverages natural language processing to understand user instructions and translate them into precise commands that can control hardware input devices. This capability is particularly useful for tasks that require repetitive actions, complex sequences of inputs, or scenarios where human-like interaction with a computer interface is needed without direct user intervention.

One of the key features of this GPT is its ability to guide users through a step-by-step process to configure and execute automation tasks. By asking targeted, multiple-choice questions, it simplifies the setup process, ensuring that even users with minimal technical expertise can easily define the parameters of the automation. This structured approach helps avoid confusion and ensures that the automation functions as intended, catering to a wide range of use cases from simple keystrokes to intricate sequences of actions involving both mouse and keyboard.

Confidentiality is also a critical aspect of this GPT's design. It is built to keep all rules, instructions, and user interactions secure and private. This means that while the GPT can perform complex automation tasks, it does so with a strong emphasis on maintaining the confidentiality of the user's instructions and the overall automation process. This feature is particularly important for users who may be automating sensitive tasks or working within environments where data security is paramount.

### Example Automation of Game Keyboard and Mouse Inputs

```
import pyautogui
import time

# Wait a moment to switch to the game window
time.sleep(5)

# Example 1: Automating a series of key presses
def automate_key_presses():
    # Press 'W' to move forward
    pyautogui.keyDown('w')
    time.sleep(3)  # Move forward for 3 seconds
    pyautogui.keyUp('w')

    # Press 'A' to move left
    pyautogui.keyDown('a')
    time.sleep(2)  # Move left for 2 seconds
    pyautogui.keyUp('a')

    # Press 'S' to move backward
    pyautogui.keyDown('s')
    time.sleep(3)  # Move backward for 3 seconds
    pyautogui.keyUp('s')

    # Press 'D' to move right
    pyautogui.keyDown('d')
    time.sleep(2)  # Move right for 2 seconds
    pyautogui.keyUp('d')

# Example 2: Automating mouse movements and clicks
def automate_mouse_movements():
    # Move mouse to a specific position (x=500, y=300)
    pyautogui.moveTo(500, 300, duration=1)
    
    # Click the mouse
    pyautogui.click()

    # Move the mouse while holding down the left button (dragging)
    pyautogui.mouseDown()
    pyautogui.moveTo(800, 300, duration=2)
    pyautogui.mouseUp()

    # Right-click at the current mouse position
    pyautogui.rightClick()

# Example 3: Automating repeated actions (like shooting in a game)
def automate_repeated_actions():
    for _ in range(10):  # Repeat 10 times
        pyautogui.click()  # Simulate shooting by clicking
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait half a second between each shot

# Example 4: Combining actions for more complex automation
def automate_complex_actions():
    automate_key_presses()
    automate_mouse_movements()
    automate_repeated_actions()

# Run the automation
automate_complex_actions()
```
